# Photo Setup Instructions

## Adding Niki Shah's Photo

To complete the About page, you need to add Niki Shah's professional photo.

### Steps:

1. **Prepare the photo**:
   - Use a professional headshot or business photo
   - Recommended: Square format (e.g., 600x600px or 800x800px)
   - Format: JPG or PNG
   - Make sure the photo is well-lit and professional

2. **Save the photo** as `niki-shah.jpg`

3. **Place it in this location**:
   ```
   /Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/shukla & co/satva-website/images/niki-shah.jpg
   ```

### What it looks like:

- The photo appears on the [About page](about-enhanced.html) in the Leadership Team section
- It's displayed as a 300x300px rounded image with a professional shadow
- If the photo isn't added yet, a placeholder with gradient background shows

### Quick Copy Command:

If the photo is on your desktop:

```bash
cp "/Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/[PHOTO-FILENAME].jpg" "/Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/shukla & co/satva-website/images/niki-shah.jpg"
```

Replace `[PHOTO-FILENAME]` with the actual filename.

## Adding Future Team Members:

When you expand the team, follow the same pattern:

2. Add to `/images/` folder
3. Update the HTML with the new team member's info

The fallback placeholder will automatically show until you add the photo!
