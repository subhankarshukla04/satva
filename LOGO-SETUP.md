# Logo Setup Instructions

## Adding the Satva Logo

You need to save your company logo image to make the website fully functional.

### Steps:

1. **Save your logo file** as `satva-logo.png` (the logo you showed me)

2. **Place it in this location**:
   ```
   /Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/shukla & co/satva-website/images/satva-logo.png
   ```

3. **File requirements**:
   - Format: PNG (with transparent background preferred)
   - Recommended size: 400px wide minimum
   - The image you showed me is perfect!

### Where the logo appears:

✅ **Welcome Screen** (homepage only) - Large centered logo with animations
✅ **Navigation Bar** (all pages) - Small logo next to "SATVA" text
✅ **All enhanced pages** - Consistent branding throughout

### Quick Copy Command:

If your logo is on your desktop, you can use:

```bash
cp "/Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/[YOUR-LOGO-FILENAME].png" "/Users/subhankarshukla/Desktop/shukla & co/satva-website/images/satva-logo.png"
```

Replace `[YOUR-LOGO-FILENAME]` with your actual logo filename.

## Alternative: Using a Different Format

If you want to use SVG or JPG instead:

1. Save the file as `satva-logo.svg` or `satva-logo.jpg`
2. The HTML code will automatically use it

---

**Note**: The website is already coded to use the logo - you just need to place the file in the images folder!
